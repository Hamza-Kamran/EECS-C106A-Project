    <h1 align="center">Home Assessment of Posture and Low-back Loading</h1>
    <h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Low-back loading looks into the various forces that interact with the lower back. It uses the magnitude and the location of the forces
        to see the impact it may have on the human body. This, particularly, is important and useful within the medical field due to the large
        amounts of procedures on the spine and lower back. Specific forces on the lower back may result in pain and may cause future complications
        to arise. Thus, these procedures require close monitoring of the lower back and how various forces are applied to it on a day-to-day basis.
        Evaluating low-back loading can help evaluate the outcomes of various surgical and other clinical procedures and help better the
        understanding of various medical procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Current procedure of evaluating posture and low-back loading requires a Kinect and a laptop with a dedicated GPU. While this works within a
        clinical setting, it is impractical outside the clinic. Shipping the Kinect and laptop proves to be very inefficient and expensive. Thus,
        this project will be improving the efficiency by implementing the data collection with an iPad and ARKit 3. In order to validate that the
        iPad can replace the Kinect, the data collected from ARKit 3 must be validated. Futhermore, since the iPad only has one camera, a
        model must be implemented in order to address the joints that are hidden. This project focuses on creating an app to collect the data and
        validating various components of data collected, such as the consistency of length of the body parts and reducing noise to check the
        joint acceleration
